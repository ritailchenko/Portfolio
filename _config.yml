  I am a graduate of Bernard Baruch College, holding BA in graphic design. I possess a strong combination of aesthetic thinking and practical approach.
  I am well versed with industry-standard design software including Photoshop and InDesign.

  Not just I bring to the table great design sense, I have strong knowledge of Web Development, which I gained at Columbia University's Bootcamp.
  My formal education and practical experience makes me an exeptional developer with creative thinking.
